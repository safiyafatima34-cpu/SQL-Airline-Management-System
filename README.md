# ✈️ SQL Airline Management System :-


## 📌 Project Overview :

This project is a **SQL-based Airline Management System** developed using **MySQL Workbench**.

It demonstrates how airline data such as **flights, passengers, and bookings** can be stored, managed, and analyzed using structured SQL queries.

The project focuses on **real-world airline operations**, including passenger bookings, ticket pricing analysis, revenue calculation, and travel routes.


## 🛠 Technologies Used :
- SQL
- MySQL
- MySQL Workbench


## 🗄 Database Tables :
The project consists of three main tables:

* **FLIGHTS** *

   Stores flight details such as flight number, source city, and destination city.
  
* **PASSENGERS**

  Stores passenger details including name, age, and city.
  
* **BOOKINGS**

  Stores booking information such as passenger ID, flight ID, ticket price, and travel date.

All tables are connected using **primary keys and foreign keys** to maintain data integrity.


## ✨ Key Features :
- Designed a relational airline database schema
- Implemented primary key and foreign key relationships
- Used JOIN operations to combine data from multiple tables
- Analyzed ticket prices using aggregate functions
- Calculated total revenue per destination
- Categorized passengers based on ticket price using CASE statements
- Applied subqueries for advanced filtering and analysis


## ▶️ How to Run the Project :
1. Open **MySQL Workbench**
2. Create a new SQL file
3. Copy and paste the SQL script from the repository
4. **Execute the script step-by-step** (database creation → tables → inserts → queries)
5. View the results of each task using SELECT queries


## 📚 Concepts Covered :
- Database design and normalization
- Primary key and foreign key constraints
- INNER JOIN operations
- Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG)
- GROUP BY clause
- Subqueries
- CASE statements
- Data filtering using WHERE, BETWEEN, and logical operators


## ✅ Project Status :
✔ Completed

✔ Tested in MySQL Workbench


This project demonstrates **practical SQL skills** commonly expected for **DBMS, SQL, and Data Analytics roles**.
